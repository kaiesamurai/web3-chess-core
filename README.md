## Challenges and Solutions

Building Web3 Chess presented its own set of challenges, particularly for a team with limited experience in full-stack dApp development. However, we overcame these challenges by experimenting with various tools and technologies, ultimately migrating to Moralis midway through the project for its powerful features such as live queries, custom React hooks, easy authentication, and seamless integration with the Core.
